# Nested Object

👨‍💼 Great! Even though forms don't technically support nested objects (again,
nested forms aren't allowed), Conform allows us to simulate that. This makes it
much easier for us to maintain a sensible data structure for our forms.

But did you notice that our database allows notes to have more than a single
image? Sure would be nice if we could add more than one image to a note, right?
Let's do that next!

💯 Now that our form is wired up with conform, we can render the errors for
these fields. Feel free to try that if you've got extra time (🧝‍♂️ Kellie will
do it for you if you don't).
