# File Validation

🦺 I'm just so relieved to have everything typed and validated.

👨‍💼 Great work!

As mentioned, we're not yet displaying errors because we've not wired up Conform
form utilities to our form. We'll be changing the structure a bit in the next
exercise so that's why we're not doing that as part of the exercise.

💯 If you've got some extra time, you can go ahead and wire the form fields up
to `conform` so you can display the errors.
