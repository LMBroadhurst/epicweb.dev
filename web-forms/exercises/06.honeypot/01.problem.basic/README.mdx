# Basic Honeypot

👨‍💼 When users sign up for an account on our app, we send a confirmation email.
If spam bots submit random people's email addresses in there, we'll get marked
as spam and our deliverability will be poor (emails we send won't get to where
they're supposed to go).

Kellie 🧝‍♂️ put together a new <LinkToApp to="/signup" /> route which accepts the
user's email address. We need you to add a honeypot field to the form so we can
detect bots and not send emails if that field is filled out.

You just need to make sure that regular users don't accidentally fill the field
out. It can be pretty basic, because many bots aren't very sophisticated. But
we'll improve it later to deal with more sophisticated bots in the future.

The form only actually redirects to `/` for right now. If the honeypot field is
filled in then the `action` should return a 400 error response (you can use
`invariantResponse` for this if you like).
