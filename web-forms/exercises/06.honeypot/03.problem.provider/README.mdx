# Honeypot Provider

👨‍💼 If a user is able to submit the form within a second of the form being
generated, they're probably not a human (or maybe they're just
[Barry Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Flash_characters#Barry_Allen_/_Flash) ⚡).
So as a part of our honeypot, we can have another hidden field that keeps track
of when the form was generated. Then when the form is submitted, we just make
sure it was submitted at least a second after it was generated.

There are a few problems with this we'll need to consider. For example, if we're
running automated tests, then our user actually _is_ a bot and that's okay 😅
So when we're running tests, we don't want to include the valid from field.

We'll know whether we're in a testing environment if `process.env.TESTING` is
set. (That's set in <InlineFile file="index.js" />). If that's set, then just
set the `validFromFieldName` to `null` and that will prevent remix-utils from
including and checking for that field. Otherwise, you can set it to a string, or
just use `undefined` to have the default value be used.

Another challenge will be is synchronizing our UI with our server config for the
honeypot fields. So we need to update <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" /> to
handle this.

There are other issues, but let's just start with this.
