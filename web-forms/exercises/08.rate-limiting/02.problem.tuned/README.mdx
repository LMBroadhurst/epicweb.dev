# Tuned Rate Limiting

👨‍💼 As a general rule, our rate limiter is ok, but for higher impact pages and
forms, we probably want to tighten things up a bit. For example, it wouldn't
make sense for a user to submit our `/signup` for a thousand times in a minute.
Maybe more like 10 times in a minute max (maybe they're just _really_ bad at
entering their proper email address).

But then for some other forms it may be ok to submit 100 times in a minute
(maybe they've got a _lot_ of notes they want to delete in a row). So we're
going to have three tiers. General, strong, and strongest.

So let's give that a whirl.
