# Honeypot Provider

👨‍💼 Great! Now we're probably going to catch even more bots! But we've got
another problem we'll want to deal with next.

🧝‍♂️ Before you get to that though, I'm going to make a small change. We're going
to apply this honeypot stuff to all our public forms, so to reduce repetition,
I'm going to move some of the boilerplate from the `action`
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/signup.tsx" />
to a utility called `checkHoneypot`
in <InlineFile file="app/utils/honeypot.server.ts" />.

Feel free to <DiffLink>check the diff</DiffLink> or even do it yourself if you
like.
