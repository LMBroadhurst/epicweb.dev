# Multi-part form data

👨‍💼 Great work! To be honest, we're being a little hand-wavy on the bit around
persisting the data. That's just out of scope for this workshop. It does highly
depend on your application and where you choose to host your images. If you'd
like to see how we're managing it in the app currently (not recommended for
production), check <InlineFile file="app/utils/db.server.ts">`updateNote`</InlineFile>.

We'll get to improving this in the future.

We're missing some nice validation and our types aren't great, let's fix that
next.
