# CSRF Setup

👨‍💼 We've got to get some things set up with the `remix-utils` CSRF utilities
before we can actually start protecting our forms. We'll dive deeper into
cookies in the [Web Auth](https://auth.epicweb.dev) workshop later, but you do
need to set a signed cookie in the user's browser so you can use
[Remix's `createCookie`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/cookies#createcookie)
to help with that.

```tsx
import { createCookie } from '@remix-run/node'

const cookie = createCookie('csrf', {
	path: '/',
	httpOnly: true,
	secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
	sameSite: 'lax',
	secrets: process.env.SESSION_SECRET.split(','),
})
```

🐨 Go ahead and stick that in <InlineFile file="app/utils/csrf.server.ts" />.

You'll notice we're using another environment variable. 🐨 You'll need to set
that up like we did with the `HONEYPOT_SECRET` earlier.

Feel free to [read the Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/utils/cookies)
all about cookies if you want to learn more about these options, but we'll get
to this stuff in more depth in the Web Auth workshop.

🐨 Once you have the cookie object created, you can use that to create a CSRF
utility;

```tsx
import { CSRF } from 'remix-utils/csrf/server'

// ...

export const csrf = new CSRF({ cookie })
```

Now, we need to get the user's unique token in our UI for our forms and in the
user's cookie so we can validate it on the server. We'll do that
in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />. 🐨 See you there!
