# Add / Remove Items

👨‍💼 Hooray, we've got a great solution for adding multiple images to our notes.
Users are going to love this feature.

💯 Did you take the time to think about the screen reader experience of our "❌"
and "➕ Image" buttons? You can use `sr-only` and `aria-hidden` to visually
hide/show different elements for screen readers. So here's how it was
implemented in my solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler alert!</summary>

<CodeFile
	file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId_.edit.tsx"
	range="180-186,192-198"
	highlight="184-185,196-197"
	buttons="solution"
/>

</details>

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a new <LinkToApp to="/signup" /> route and link to it from
the <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" /> file for the next exercise. It'll just be
a form that takes an "email" input. Feel free to put that together if you have
extra time, or you can <DiffLink>check my work</DiffLink>.
